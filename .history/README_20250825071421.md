# FloodSafe AI - Flood Risk Assessment System

FloodSafe AI is a web-based application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze images and provide accurate flood risk assessments. The system processes terrain and flood images to identify potential risks and provide actionable recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Analysis**: Upload images of terrain or flooded areas for detailed analysis
- **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Get risk levels, probability percentages, elevation estimates, and distance from water
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Receive specific guidance based on the analysis results
- **Analysis History**: Save and review previous assessments
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Netlify Functions**: Serverless backend for image analysis

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (Serverless)
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for user data and history
- **Deployment**: Netlify

## Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd flood-assessment-js

2. Open the application

Simply open index.html in your web browser

Or use a local server for better functionality:

# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx serve

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000

3. Access the application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000

Production Deployment on Netlify
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify

Go to Netlify

Click "New site from Git"

Connect your GitHub account and select your repository

2. Configure build settings (automatically detected):

Build command: (leave empty - no build process needed)

Publish directory: . (current directory)

Deploy your site

Netlify will automatically deploy your site

Your site will be available at https://your-site-name.netlify.app

Environment variables (Optional for advanced setup):

If using Gemini AI in the future, add GEMINI_API_KEY in Netlify dashboard

Go to Site settings > Environment variables

Usage Guide
1. Account Creation
Click on "Login" in the navigation bar

Switch to "Register" to create a new account

Provide your name, email, and password

2. Image Analysis
Navigate to the "Analysis" section

Select the region type and season from the dropdown menus

Upload an image by dragging and dropping or clicking to browse

Click "Analyze Flood Risk" to process the image

View the detailed results including risk level, probability, and recommendations

3. Viewing History
Go to the "History" section to review past analyses

Filter results by time period or risk level

Each entry shows the date, risk level, and basic information

How It Works
Frontend (Browser)
User uploads images through the responsive UI

JavaScript processes the image and sends it to Netlify function

Results are displayed with detailed risk assessment

Backend (Netlify Function)
Serverless function handles image analysis

Currently uses simulated AI responses

Can be extended with real AI APIs like Google Gemini

Data Storage
User authentication data stored in localStorage

Analysis history persisted in browser storage

No server-side database required

Customization
Modifying Analysis Responses
Edit netlify/functions/analyze-image/analyze-image.js to change:

Risk assessment logic

Response formats

Recommendation templates

Styling Changes
Modify styles/style.css to customize:

Color scheme and branding

Layout and responsive behavior

Component styles

Adding New Features
Add new JavaScript modules in the scripts/ directory

Update HTML in index.html for new UI elements

Extend Netlify functions for new backend capabilities

Browser Support
Chrome 60+

Firefox 55+

Safari 12+

Edge 79+

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Images not uploading

Check file size (max 10MB)

Ensure file is JPG or PNG format

Analysis not working

Check browser console for error messages (F12)

Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

Netlify deployment issues

Verify netlify.toml configuration is correct

Check that all files are committed to GitHub

Function errors

Check Netlify function logs in the dashboard

Ensure function dependencies are correctly specified

Getting Help
If you encounter issues:

Check the browser console for error messages (F12)

Examine Netlify deployment logs in the dashboard

Ensure all files are properly committed to your repository

Future Enhancements
Integrate real Google Gemini AI API

Add more detailed image analysis capabilities

Implement user accounts with cloud storage

Add export functionality for reports

Include historical flood data integration
